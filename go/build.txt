Build:
Workspace should be created like below.

$GOPATH + src/github.com/<github username>/<name of component>

For example,
$go-work/src/github.com/tkshmichihiro/helloworld

- go install will install the compiled binary in $GOPATH/bin.
- Run go install under $GOPATH/src

Static link is used:
Go command executables are statically linked; the package objects need not be present to run Go programs.
